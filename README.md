Welcome to the Cherab project. This is the JET specific machine package.

To install the package, clone the repository and run:

```bash
pip install <path-to-cherab-jet>
```

If you wish to develop the package then consider passing the `-e` option to `pip`.
This will install the package in `develop` mode and make your changes visible without reinstalling the package.
Please make any changes against the `development` branch.

Please see our [documentation](https://cherab.github.io/documentation/index.html)
for guidance on using the code.
